📊 Unlocking Growth in CPG & FMCG: The Power of the Lorenz Curve! 🚀

In the fast-paced world of CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) and FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods), understanding market dynamics is key to driving growth. One powerful but often overlooked tool? The Lorenz Curve.

Traditionally used to analyze wealth inequality, the Lorenz Curve can reveal crucial insights in CPG & FMCG:

✅ Sales & Revenue Concentration – Are 20% of your SKUs driving 80% of sales? Visualizing sales distribution helps optimize product portfolios.

✅ Customer Contribution – Which customers are your high-value buyers? Identifying revenue concentration among customer segments helps fine-tune marketing strategies.

✅ Retail Store Performance – Are a few stores accounting for most of your revenue? Understanding geographic sales concentration aids in store-level promotions and distribution decisions.

✅ Marketing Spend Efficiency – Is your ad budget driving broad impact or just benefiting a small fraction of the market? The Lorenz Curve helps evaluate ROI on marketing investments.

✅ Inventory & Demand Planning – Are certain products disproportionately affecting your inventory turnover? This analysis helps streamline supply chain strategies.

📈 By visualizing concentration vs. equality in key business areas, CPG and FMCG brands can make data-driven decisions that maximize efficiency and profitability.

📢 Is Your Product Portfolio a Hidden Risk? Let’s Talk Optimization! 🚀

In the world of FMCG & CPG, success often comes from a diverse and well-optimized product portfolio. But here’s the real question: Are you unknowingly over-relying on a few products?

🔍 How do we measure this?
Metrics like the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI), Concentration Ratio (CR), and Gini Coefficient help uncover hidden revenue concentration risks:
✅ High HHI? Your revenue is controlled by a few dominant products—risky if consumer preferences shift.
✅ High CR (Top 4 products = 80% of revenue)? You’re heavily dependent on a few SKUs.
✅ High Gini Coefficient? Revenue is unequally distributed across products, leaving gaps in your portfolio.

📊 Why does this matter?
A poorly optimized portfolio can lead to supply chain bottlenecks, missed growth opportunities, and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Companies that diversify and optimize their product mix are more resilient in the long run.

🚀 What’s the next step?
Leverage data-driven insights to rebalance your portfolio, promote underperforming SKUs strategically, and launch new high-potential products. A well-diversified product mix isn’t just about revenue—it’s about long-term stability and scalability.

The charts you provided represent the Lorenz Curve and a Product-wise Revenue Distribution, which are useful for analyzing Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) / Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies in terms of revenue contribution by different products. Let's break down the insights:
'
Left Chart: Lorenz Curve & Gini Coefficient
The Lorenz Curve (blue line) shows the cumulative percentage of revenue contributed by the cumulative percentage of products.

The red dashed line represents perfect equality, meaning each product contributes equally to the total revenue.

The blue shaded area indicates deviation from perfect equality, highlighting the level of concentration of revenue among a few products.

The Gini Coefficient (0.2660) quantifies this inequality (values close to 0 indicate more equal distribution, while values closer to 1 indicate high concentration).

Application in FMCG/CPG Industry
Helps in identifying high-performing products vs. low-performing products.

A high Gini coefficient suggests a few products drive most of the revenue (80/20 rule – Pareto Principle).

Companies can focus on key revenue-generating products while optimizing or phasing out low-performing ones.

Right Chart: Product-wise Revenue Distribution & Cumulative Share
The bar chart (light blue) represents the revenue contribution of individual products, sorted from highest to lowest.

The red cumulative curve (right axis) tracks the cumulative revenue contribution.

Application in FMCG/CPG
Brand/Product Portfolio Management: Helps in SKU rationalization (deciding which products to keep, improve, or discontinue).

Pricing & Marketing Strategy: High-revenue products can be the focus of promotions or premium pricing strategies.

Supply Chain & Inventory Management: Identifies the most critical products for stock management.

General Applications of Lorenz Curve
Wealth Distribution:

Used in economics to analyze income inequality in societies.

A high Gini coefficient means wealth is concentrated in a few hands.

Brand Evaluation:

Companies can assess brand contribution to total revenue and optimize marketing investments.

Product Portfolio Evaluation:

Helps in portfolio balancing, ensuring a mix of high-performing and emerging products.

Alternative Visualizations for Product Portfolio Evaluation
While the Lorenz Curve is useful, additional visualizations can provide better granularity and actionable insights.

1. Pareto Chart (Bar + Cumulative Line)
Similar to the right-side chart in your image but with a cumulative threshold line at 80% revenue contribution.

Helps in quickly identifying the key products driving revenue.

📊 Use Case:

SKU rationalization by focusing on the most profitable products.

2. Revenue Contribution Heatmap
A matrix-style heatmap showing product revenue contribution over time.

Allows tracking of seasonal trends, new product performance, and declining products.

📊 Use Case:

Helps in demand forecasting and inventory management.

3. BCG (Boston Consulting Group) Matrix
Divides products into four quadrants based on market growth rate and market share:

Stars (High growth, High market share) – Invest & expand

Cash Cows (Low growth, High market share) – Maintain & optimize

Question Marks (High growth, Low market share) – Decide whether to invest or discontinue

Dogs (Low growth, Low market share) – Consider phasing out

📊 Use Case:

Helps in investment decisions for product development.

4. Treemap of Revenue Contribution
A hierarchical visualization where each product is represented as a rectangle.

The size of the rectangle correlates with revenue contribution.

📊 Use Case:

Provides a quick glance at which products dominate revenue.

5. ABC Analysis (A = High, B = Medium, C = Low Revenue Contributors)
Products are categorized into:

A: Top 20% of products generating 80% revenue.

B: Next 30% of products generating 15% revenue.

C: Remaining 50% generating 5% revenue.

📊 Use Case:

Prioritization in supply chain and inventory management.

Conclusion: Choosing the Right Visualization
Lorenz Curve & Gini Coefficient: Best for measuring overall revenue inequality.

Pareto Chart & ABC Analysis: Best for SKU rationalization.

BCG Matrix: Best for strategic investment in product categories.

Heatmaps & Treemaps: Best for visualizing revenue trends over time.
